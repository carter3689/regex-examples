    "\n",
    "#### Example: Find 4 Digits in a String\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "some_string = \"Here is some text. We want to find matches in. Let's find the number 1234 and the number 5342 but not the number 942003. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "regex_pattern = re.compile(r\"\\D(\\d{4})\\D\")\n",
    "matching_numbers = re.findall(regex_pattern, some_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(matching_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part here is the `regex pattern`. Let's break it apart into 3 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "`r\"<first><desired_match><last>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`<first>` is `\\D`\n",
    "\n",
    "`desired_match` is `(\\d{4})`\n",
    "\n",
    "`<last>` is `\\D`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`<first>` is telling python that anything that isn't a digit, just ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<last>` is telling python that anythingn that isn't a digit, just ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`desired_match` is saying that the pattern in `()` should be considered as a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting `\\d` would yeild all 3 sets of numbers `1234`, `5342`, and `942003`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting `\\d{4}` is saying that the digits must be a at least 4 digits to match. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `<last>` portion prevents digits larger than 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Extract Capitalized Words\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "All items in `()` are what we want to return\n",
    "\n",
    "`[A-Z]{1}` means matching item has 1 capital letter\n",
    "\n",
    "`[a-z]+` means the matching item has lower case letter(s). If we change this portion to: `[a-z]*` we would also have `A` in our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\\s` means: do not include spaces in the result\n",
    "\n",
    "`?` means repeat the previous pattern as needed, or repeat `([A-Z]{1}[a-z]+)\\s` as many as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Capitalized and Punctuated. \n",

    "`^` Denotes start of string\n",
    "\n",
    "`$` Denotes end of string\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`(.*)` nearly any value in between start and end of the string\n",
    "\n",
